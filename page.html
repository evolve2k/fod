      Hi sweetie, what did you plan for our date night dinner? /
    </p>
    <p>
      I went past this fresh donut place and it smelled SO GOOD. Well, I thought let's have Donuts and grabbed us a mega jumbo box, so there's enough to eat.
      <br/> Wait, sorry, what?! /
    </p>
    <p>
    That's not food! That's FOD! /
    </p>

      &quot;What is Fod?&quot;

    <h2 id="what-is-fod">What is Fod?</h2>
    <p>
      Fod is a term to describe anything you consume that is not worthy of being called Food on the basis that it does not meet the strict definition of food as materials that consists of essential body nutrients and that which nourish us.
    </p>
    <h2 id="why-a-new-definition">Why a new definition</h2>
    <p>
      Part of the problem is one of linguistics or what we say. My mother once said to me &quot;There's no real food in a donut&quot;, she meant that there's nothing in there your body really needs and worse your body is going to suffer and struggle by you sticking it in your mouth.
        </p>
    <p>
      As such 'real food' is one way to describe the opposite of junk food, the items you should be taking into your body.
    </p>
    <h2 id="what-about-junk-food">What about &quot;Junk Food&quot;</h2>
    <p>
      What about it? The term 'junk food' is a broken as it still keeps enforcing that those items are still a 'food'. We're saying enough is enough and that it's time to claim back the word food and we can do this by spreading a new word to describe all of this &quot;not real food&quot;

      It's like this, materials that have been shown not to kill a rat in 3 days gets marked as &quot;suitable for human consumption&quot;. A consumable is anything you could put in your mouth without you know poisoning you. / [girl and boy facing each other on a table staring at each other]

      Separation Separation is a food problem where we move further and further from what we eat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Excessive separation leads to a reduction in real food in what we consume.
    </p>
    <p>
      Separation can occur from 1. Too many processing stages 2. Too many additives/ adjustments 3. Inclusion of cheap bulk filler items

      Additicification occurs when fod manufacturers lean on the tried-and-true principals of desire enhancement.
