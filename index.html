              Hey sweetie,
              <br>what did you plan

              I went past a fresh donut
              <br>place and it smelled so
              <br>good. I grabbed us a mega-jumbo box, so

                <strong >
                  Fod is any substance that people or animals consume that is <em>not worthy of being called food</em>.

            </p>
            <h2>Why a new term?</h2>
            <p>
              The Oxford English Dictoniary defines food as:
              <blockquote>
                <strong>
                  Any <em>nutritious</em> substance that people or animals eat or drink or that plants absorb in order <em>to maintain life and growth</em></strong> (emphasis added)
                [<a href="http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/food">1</a>]
              </blockquote>
            </p>
            <p>So literally by definition to be actual food it must nutritious.</p>
            <p>Mentally scan your local supermarket shelves, applying the standard dictionary definition of food how many <em>food products</em> are actually food?</p>
            <p>It's time to reclaim the word food and while we're at it were claiming back the word <strong>eat</strong> to just apply to <em>actual</em> <strong>food</strong></em>.</p>

            <p>
              My mother once said to me "There's no real food in a donut", she meant that there's nothing in there your body really needs and worse your body is going to suffer and struggle by you sticking it in your mouth. Part of the problem is one of linguistics or what we say. ‘Real food’ is one way to describe the opposite of junk food, the items you should be taking into your body.

            <h2>Relax it's non-toxic</h2>
            <p>
              So a <strong>consumable</strong> is anything you could put in your mouth without, you know, poisoning you.

              Fod has been spreading throughout the world. The issue is that fod has started to crowd out regular food.
            </p>
            <p>
              The good news is that people are waking up and starting to realize what is food and what is not.
            </p>
            <p>
              No-one is saying you can’t enjoy a bit of fod from time to time, but lets call it what it is.

            <h2>It's all about <em>separation</em></h2>
            <p>
              <strong>Separation</strong> is a food problem where we move further and further from what we eat.
              Excessive separation leads to a reduction in real food in what we consume.
            </p>
            <p class="listlead">
              Separation can occur from:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>Too many processing stages</li>
              <li>Too many additives/adjustments</li>
              <li>Inclusion of cheap bulk filler items</li>

            <h2>Addictification means what?</h2>
            <p>
              <strong>Additicification</strong> occurs when fod manufacturers lean on the tried-and-true principals of desire enhancement.

              Additicification can occur from:
