              I went past a fresh donut
              <br>place and it smelled so
              <br>good. I grabbed us a mega-jumbo box, so
              <br>there's enough to eat.<br>

          <h2>What is Fod?</h2>
          <p>
            Fod is a term to describe anything you consume that is not worthy of being called food.
          </p>
          <p>
            In more details it’s on the basis that it does not meet the strict definition of food as materials that consists of essential body nutrients and that which nourish us.

          <h2>Is donut food?</h2>
          <p>
            My mother once said to me "There's no real food in a donut", she meant that there's nothing in there your body really needs and worse your body is going to suffer and struggle by you sticking it in your mouth. Part of the problem is one of linguistics or what we say. ‘Real food’ is one way to describe the opposite of junk food, the items you should be taking into your body.

              Fod has been spreading throughout the world. The issue is that fod has started to crowd out regular food.
            </p>
            <p>
              The good news is that people are waking up and starting to realize what is food and what is not.
            </p>
            <p>
              No-one is saying you can’t enjoy a bit of fod from time to time, but lets call it what it is.

            <h2>It's all about <em>separation</em></h2>
            <p>
              Separation is a food problem where we move further and further from what we eat.
              Excessive separation leads to a reduction in real food in what we consume.
            </p>
            <p class="listlead">
              Separation can occur from:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>Too many processing stages</li>
              <li>Too many additives/adjustments</li>
              <li>Inclusion of cheap bulk filler items</li>

            <h2>Addictification means what?</h2>
            <p>
              Additicification occurs when fod manufacturers lean on the tried-and-true principals of desire enhancement.
