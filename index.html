          <h2>Is donut food?</h2>
          <p>
            My mother once said to me "There's no real food in a donut", she meant that there's nothing in there your body really needs and worse your body is going to suffer and struggle by you sticking it in your mouth. Part of the problem is one of linguistics or what we say. ‘Real food’ is one way to describe the opposite of junk food, the items you should be taking into your body.

          <p>
            Products that fail to kill a rat in three days are classified as "fit for human consumption".  A <strong>consumable</strong> is anything you could put in your mouth without, you know, poisoning you.  No stress, it’ll be fine

          <h2>It's all about <em>separation</em></h2>
          <p>
            Separation is a food problem where we move further and further from what we eat.
            Excessive separation leads to a reduction in real food in what we consume.
          </p>
          <p>
            Separation can occur from:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Too many processing stages</li>
            <li>Too many additives/adjustments</li>
            <li>Inclusion of cheap bulk filler items</li>
          </ol>

          <h2>Addictification means what?</h2>
          <p>
            Additicification occurs when fod manufacturers lean on the tried-and-true principals of desire enhancement.

            Additicification can occur from:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>More Sugar</li>
            <li>More Fat</li>
            <li>More Crunch</li>
            <li>Insatiability</li>
